These techniques have multiple benefits: the instructor can easily and quickly assess if students have really mastered the material (and plan to dedicate more time to it, if necessary), and the process of measuring student understanding in many cases is also practice for the material—often students do not actually learn the material until asked to make use of it in assessments such as these. Finally, the very nature of these assessments drives interactivity and brings several benefits. Students are revived from their passivity of merely listening to a lecture and instead become attentive and engaged, two prerequisites for effective learning. These techniques are often perceived as “fun”, yet they are frequently more effective than lectures at enabling student learning.

Not all techniques listed here will have universal appeal, with factors such as your teaching style and personality influencing which choices may be right for you.


## Instructor Action: Lecture

1. **Picture Prompt** – Show students an image with no explanation, and ask them to dentify/explain it, and justify their answers. Or ask students to write about it using terms from lecture, or to name the processes and concepts shown. Also works well as group ctivity. Do not give the “answer” until they have explored all options first.

> 1. **图片提示** – 向学生展示一张图片，不对图片进行解释。要求学生识别 / 解释它，调整他们的答案。或要求学生使用课程中的概念写下来，或给显示出来的流程或概念命名。也可以当作小组活动。在学生给出所有选项之前，不要给出答案。



2. **Think Break** – Ask a rhetorical question, and then allow 20 seconds for students to hink about the problem before you go on to explain. This technique encourages students o take part in the problem-solving process even when discussion isn't feasible. Having tudents write something down (while you write an answer also) helps assure that they ill in fact work on the problem.

3. **Updating Notes** – Take a break for 2-3 minutes to allow students to compare their class otes so far with other students, fill in gaps, and develop joint questions.

4. **Cliffhanger Lecturing** – Rather than making each topic fit neatly within one day’s lass period, intentionally structure topics to end three-fourths of the way through the ime, leaving one quarter of the time to start the next module/topic. This generates an utomatic bridge between sessions and better meets learning science principles of the pacing effect and interleaving topics.

5. **Choral Response** – Ask a one-word answer to the class at large; volume of answer will uggest degree of comprehension. Very useful to “drill” new vocabulary words into tudents.

6. **Word Cloud Guessing** – Before you introduce a new concept to students, show them a ord cloud on that topic, using an online generator (Wordle, Taxedo, or Tagul) to paste a aragraph or longer of related text, and challenge students to guess what the topic was.

7. **Instructor Storytelling** – Instructor illustrates a concept, idea, or principle with a reallife application, model, or case-study.

8. **Grab a Volunteer** – After a minute paper (or better: think pair share) pick one student o stand up, cross the room, and read any other student's answer.

9. **Socratic Questioning** – The instructor replaces lecture by peppering students with uestions, always asking the next question in a way that guides the conversation toward a earning outcome (or major Driving Question) that was desired from the beginning. ariation: A group of students writes a series of questions as homework and leads the xercise in class.  10. **Reverse Socratic Questioning** – The instructor requires students to ask him/her uestions, and the instructor answers in such a way as to goad another question mmediately but also drive the next student question in a certain direction.

11. **Pass the Pointer** – Place a complex, intricate, or detailed image on the screen and ask or volunteers to temporarily borrow the laser pointer to identify key features or ask uestions about items they don’t understand.

12. **Turn My Back** – Face away from the class, ask for a show of hands for how many people id the reading. After they put hands down, turn around again and ask to hear a report of he percentage. This provides an indication of student preparation for today’s material.

13. **Empty Outlines** – Distribute a partially completed outline of today’s lecture and ask tudents to fill it in. Useful at start or at end of class.

14. **Classroom Opinion Polls** – Informal hand-raising suffices to test the waters before a ontroversial subject.

15. **Discussion Row** – Students take turns sitting in a front row that can earn extra credit s individuals when they volunteer to answer questions posed in class; this provides a roup that will ALWAYS be prepared and interact with teacher questions.

16. **Total Physical Response (TPR)** – Students either stand or sit to indicate their binary nswers, such as True/False, to the instructor’s questions.

17. **Student Polling** – Select some students to travel the room, polling the others on a topic elevant to the course, then report back the results for everyone.

18. **Self-Assessment of Ways of Learning** – Prepare a questionnaire for students that robes what kind of learning style they use, so the course can match visual/aural/tactile earning styles.

19. **Quote Minus One** – Provide a quote relevant to your topic but leave out a crucial word nd ask students to guess what it might be: “I cannot forecast to you the action of _____; it is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.” This engages them uickly in a topic and makes them feel invested.

20. **Everyday Ethical Dilemmas** – Present an abbreviated case study with an ethical ilemma related to the discipline being studied.

21. **Polar Opposites** – Ask the class to examine two written-out versions of a theory (or orollary, law of nature, etc.), where one is incorrect, such as the opposite or a negation of he other. In deciding which is correct, students will have to examine the problem from all ngles.

22. **Pop Culture** – Infuse your lectures, case studies, sample word problems for use during lass with current events from the pop culture world. Rather than citing statistics for ousing construction, for instance, illustrate the same statistical concept you are teaching y inventing statistics about something students gossip about, like how often a certain op star appears in public without make-up.

23. **Make Them Guess** – Introduce a new subject by asking an intriguing question, omething that few will know the answer to (but should interest all of them). Accept blind uessing for a while before giving the answer to build curiosity.

24. **Make It Personal** – Design class activities (or even essays) to address the real lives of he individual students. Instead of asking for reflections on Down’s Syndrome, ask for ersonal stories of neurological problems by a family member or anyone they have ever et.

25. **Read Aloud** – Choose a small text (500 words or less) to read aloud, and ask students to ay particular attention during this phase of lecture. A small text read orally in a larger ecture can focus attention.

26. **Punctuated Lectures** – Ask student to perform five steps: listen, stop, reflect, write, ive feedback. Students become self-monitoring listeners.

27. **Word of the Day** – Select an important term and highlight it throughout the class ession, working it into as many concepts as possible. Challenge students to do the same n their interactive activities.

28. **Recall, Summarize, Question, Connect, and Comment** – This method of starting ach session (or each week) has five steps to reinforce the previous session’s material: ecall it, summarize it, phrase a remaining question, connect it to the class as a whole, nd comment on that class session.  29. **Background Knowledge Probe** – Use questionnaire (multi-choice or short answer) hen introducing a new topic.

30. **Goal Ranking and Matching** – Students rank their goals for the class, then instructor ombines those with her own list.

31. **Interest/Knowledge/Skills Checklist** – Assesses interest and preparation for the ourse, and can help adjust teaching agenda.

32. **Documented Problem Solutions** – Keep track of the steps needed to solve specific ypes of problems. Model a list for students first and then ask them to perform similar teps.

33. **Provocative Picture** – Begin the lecture with a picture meant to provoke discussion or motion (another option: a cartoon). nstructor Action: Lecture (Small Class Size)

34. **Pass the Chalk** – Provide chalk or a soft toy; whoever has it must answer your next uestion, and they pass it on to the student of their choice.

35. **Whiteboard Capture** – Using a smartphone, take photographs of the whiteboard at the nd of the day and post them to Canvas (labeled by date) for easy student reference.

36. **Pass the Dart** – Like Pass the Chalk, use a real (but safe?) dartboard to decide which tudent must answer the next question (student names are arranged on the dartboard lready).

37. **Beach Ball Bingo** – Write questions or prompts onto all surfaces of a beach ball (or ape them on). When the next student catches the ball, he/she answers one of the uestions where fingers are touching the ball.

38. **Bingo Balls of Doom** – Every student is assigned a number; when the faculty member ulls that number from the bingo cage, that student has to answer the next question.

39. **Town Hall Meeting** – Abdicate the front of the room for a student willing to speak out n a controversial subject, and when she is done with her comment, she selects the next peaker from the hands raised.

40. **The Half Class Lecture** – Divide the class in half and provide reading material to one alf. Lecture on that same material to the other half of the class. Then, switch the groups nd repeat, ending with a recap by pairing up members of opposite groups.

41. **Tournament** – Divide the class into at least two groups and announce a competition for ost points on a practice test. Let them study a topic together and then give that quiz, allying points. After each round, let them study the next topic before quizzing again. The oints should be carried over from round to round. The student impulse for competition ill focus their engagement onto the material itself.

42. **Three Part Interview** – Pose the following question to the entire class: “What do you hink are the three biggest issues related to ____.” Choose the student with the birthday losest to today’s date and have them stand and share their 3 responses to the question or one minute. Move clockwise around the room until all have shared. tudent Action: Individual (many of these can be used as partnerwork or groupwork instead; r may escalate to that after some individual effort)

43. **Mind Dump** – Students write for five minutes on last night's reading, and this paper ets collected. The entire chapter's worth of mind dumps are returned as a surprise to elp students study for the test.

44. **One-Minute Papers** – Students write for one minute on a specific question (which ight be generalized to “what was the most important thing you learned today”). Best sed at the end of the class session.

45. **Backchannel Discussion** – While the instructor presents, students use digital devices o engage in a chatroom-style conversation projected alongside the instructor. Students sk questions, make comments, and share relevant resources. The instructor periodically ies the conversation into their presentation.  46. **Muddiest Point** – Like the Minute Paper, but asks for the “most confusing” point nstead. Best used at the end of the class session.

47. **Misconception Check** – Discover class’s preconceptions. Useful for starting new hapters.

48. **Drawing for Understanding** – Students illustrate an abstract concept or idea. omparing drawings around the room can clear up misconceptions.

49. **Snowballs** – Ball up several blank pieces of paper and throw them around the room. ach time a “snowball” lands on a desk, the recipient must write three takeaways from oday’s (or yesterday’s) class, taking care not to duplicate other ideas already on this aper, and then throw it onward. After nine ideas are on each page, pause for students to ebrief the pages in groups.

50. **Focused Listing** – Students list several ideas related to the main focus point (example: ist all the possible causes of the Civil War). Helpful for starting new topics, such as a rainstorm.

51. **Focused Listing by Letter** – Same as “focused listing” but students are restricted to tart each term in their list with just one letter announced by the teacher (ie, “all answers ust start with an S”).

52. **Gallery Walk** – Stations or displays are spread across the room, and students go around o each station individually or in groups, completing a task or responding to a prompt at ach station.

53. **Turn Taking Reading** – Instead of the instructor reading a paragraph on screen (or eaving silence for students to do it), instruct them we will sit in silence until someone is oved to read ONE sentence, then someone else – anyone – will start the next sentence. dds “good” tension and raises energy.

54. **Haiku** – Students write a haiku (a three-line poem: 5-syllables, then 7, then 5) on a given opic or concept, and then share it with others.

55. **Whip Around** – Give students a few seconds to think of their answer to a question, then ove around the whole class with each one giving their (one word?) answer. Disallow epeat answers (but do allow a “pass” if necessary).

56. **Rotating Chair** – One volunteer “takes the microphone” at a time, then calls on the next olunteer. Each subsequent speaker must summarize the previous one’s points (or, if esired, ALL the speakers thus far) before adding original ideas.

57. **Media Break** – Designate a two minute break in the middle of class for students to heck their electronic devices, with the understanding they won’t use them otherwise in he entire class period.

58. **Photo Homework** – Students are assigned to use a smartphone to snap a picture of omething at home (or out in the city) that captures a specific concept from the class, as ssigned by the teacher.

59. **Board of Artwork** – Post publicly the collected drawings / abstract concepts that tudents turned in for a previous activity and create an opportunity for discussion and ebrief.

60. **Time Traveler** – Students video themselves at the start of the semester answering uestions similar to the eventual final exam, then critique it near the end of the term.

61. **Circle the Questions** – Pre-make a handout that has a few dozen likely student uestions (make them specific) on your topic for that day and ask students to circle the nes they don’t know the answers to, then turn in the paper.

62. **Ask the Winner** – Ask students to silently solve a problem on the board. After revealing he answer, instruct those who got it right to raise their hands (and keep them raised); hen, all other students are to talk to someone with a raised hand to better understand the uestion and how to solve it next time.

63. **What’s the Principle** – After recognizing the problem, students assess what principle o apply in order to solve it. Helps focus on problem TYPES rather than individual pecific problems. Principle(s) should be listed out.

64. **Video Selfie** – Ask students to make a video of themselves performing the homework or lab), as they will take it more seriously and be more likely to avoid mistakes.

65. **Infographic** – Students use online services (visual.ly, infogr.am) to create an nfographic that combines flowchart logic and visual presentation  66. **Bookmark Notes** – Distribute full-length paper to be used as a bookmark for the urrent chapter. On it, record prompts and other “reading questions”, and require tudents to record their notes, observations, and objections while reading onto these ookmarks for collection and discussion in class.

67. **True or False?** – Distribute index cards (one to each student) on which is written a tatement. Half of the cards will contain statements that are true, half false. Students ecide if theirs is one of the true statements or not, using whatever means they desire. ariation: designate half the room a space for those who think their statements are true, nd the other half for false.

68. **“Real-World”** – Have students discuss in class how a topic or concept relates to a realworld application or product. Then have students write about this topic for homework. ariation: ask them to record their answer on index cards.

69. **Concept Mapping** – Students write keywords onto sticky notes and then organize them nto a flowchart. Could be less structured: students simply draw the connections they ake between concepts.

70. **Advice Letter** – Students write a letter of advice to future students on how to be uccessful students in that course.

71. **Tabloid Titles** – Ask students to write a tabloid-style headline that would illustrate the oncept currently being discussed. Share and choose the best.

72. **Bumper Stickers** – Ask students to write a slogan-like bumper sticker to illustrate a articular concept from lecture. Variation: can be used to ask them to sum up the entire ourse in one sentence.

73. **One-Sentence Summary** – Summarize the topic into one sentence that incorporates ll of who/what/when/where/why/how creatively.

74. **Directed Paraphrasing** – Students asked to paraphrase part of a lesson for a specific udience (and a specific purpose).

75. **Word Journal** – First, summarize the entire topic on paper with a single word. Then se a paragraph to explain your word choice.

76. **Truth Statements** – Either to introduce a topic or check comprehension, ask ndividuals to list out “It is true that...” statements on the topic being discussed. The nsuing discussion might illustrate how ambiguous knowledge is sometimes.

77. **Objective Check** – Students write a brief essay in which they evaluate to what extent heir work fulfills an assignment’s objectives.

78. **Opposites** – Instructor lists out one or more concepts, for which students must come up ith an antonym, and then defend their choice.

79. **Student Storytelling** – Students are given assignments that make use of a given oncept in relation to something that seems personally relevant (such as requiring the opic to be someone in their family).

80. **Application to Major** – During last 15 minutes of class, ask students to write a short rticle about how the point applies to their major.

81. **Pro and Con Grid** – Students list out the pros and cons for a given subject.

82. **Harvesting** – After an experience/activity in class, ask students to reflect on “what” they earned, “so what” (why is it important and what are the implications), and “now what” how to apply it or do things differently).

83. **Chain Notes** – Instructor pre-distributes index cards and passes around an envelope, on hich is written a question relating to the learning environment (i.e., are the group iscussions useful?) Students write a very brief answer, drop in their own card, and pass he envelope to the next student.

84. **Focused Autobiographical Sketches** – Focuses on a single successful learning xperience, one relevant to the current course.

85. **Course-Related Self-Confidence Surveys** – Simple questions that measure how elf-confident students are when it comes to a specific skill. Once they become aware they an do it, they focus on it more.

86. **Profiles of Admirable Individuals** – Students write a brief profile of an individual in  field related to the course. Students assess their own values and learn best practices for his field.  87. **Memory Matrix** – Identify a key taxonomy and then design a grid that represents those nterrelationships. Keep it simple at first. Avoid trivial or ambiguous relationships, which end to backfire by focusing students on superficial kinds of learning. Although probably ost useful in introductory courses, this technique can also be used to help develop basic tudy skills for students who plan to continue in the field

88. **Categorizing Grid** – Hand out rectangles divided into cells and a jumbled listing of erms that need to be categorized by row and column.

89. **Defining Features Matrix** – Hand out a simple table where students decide if a efining feature is PRESENT or ABSENT. For instance, they might have to read through everal descriptions of theories and decide if each refers to behaviorist or constructivist odels of learning.

90. **What/How/Why Outlines** – Write brief notes answering the what / how / why uestions when analyzing a message or text.

91. **Approximate Analogies** – Students provide the second half of an analogy (A is to B as  is to Y).

92. **Problem Recognition Tasks** – Offer case studies with different types of problems and sk students to identify the TYPE of problem (which is different from solving it)

93. **Switch it up!** – Ask students to work on one problem for a few minutes and ntentionally move to a second problem without debriefing the first one, then solve the econd one and only then return to the first one for more work. A carefully chosen second roblem can shed light on the first problem, but this also works well if the problems are ot directly related to each other.

94. **Reading Rating Sheets** – Students fill out a ratings sheet on the course readings, on ow clear, useful, and interesting it was.

95. **Assignment Assessments** – Students give feedback on their homework assignments, nd evaluate them as learning tools.

96. **Exam Evaluations** – Students explain what they are learning from exams, and evaluate he fairness, usefulness, and quality of tests.

97. **Group-Work Evaluations** – Questionnaires asking how effective groupwork has been n the class.

98. **Teacher-Designed Feedback Forms** – Rather than use standardized evaluation orms, teachers create ones tailored for their needs and their classes. Especially useful idway through the term.

99. **Writing Fables** – Students write an animal fable (or at least sketch its outline) that will ead to a one-sentence moral matching the current concept discussed in class. May be one verbally instead. tudent Action: Pairs

100. **Think-Pair-Share** – Students share and compare possible answers to a question with a artner before addressing the larger class.

101. **Pair-Share-Repeat** – After a pair-share experience, ask students to find a new partner nd debrief the wisdom of the old partnership to this new partner.

102. **Teach-OK** – The instructor briefly explains a concept. The teacher then says “teach!”, nd the students respond “OK!”. Students then form pairs and take turns re-teaching the oncept to one another.

103. **Wisdom of Another** – After any individual brainstorm or creative activity, partner tudents up to share their results. Then, call for volunteers of students who found their artner’s work to be interesting or exemplary. Students are sometimes more willing to hare in plenary the work of fellow students than their own work.

104. **Human Flashcards** – Students take turns calling out terms they were expected to emorize, and demand an answer from their partner.

105. **Storytelling Gaps** – One partner relay a story that summarizes learning in the chapter o far, but leaves out crucial fine information (such as dates that should have been emorized). The partner listens and records dates silently on paper as the story rogresses and then updates the first person.  106. **Do-Si-Do** – Students do partner work first, then sound off by twos. All of the 2’s stand p and find a new partner (the 1’s are seated and raise their hands until a new partner omes), then debrief what was said with the first partner. Variation: Later, all the 1’s come ogether in a large circle for a group debrief, while the 2’s have their own circle.

107. **Forced Debate** – Students debate in pairs, defending either their preferred position or he opposite of their preferred position. Variation: Half the class takes one position, half he other. The two halves line up, face each other, and debate. Each student may only peak once, so that all students on both sides can engage the issue.

108. **Optimist/Pessimist** – In pairs, students take opposite emotional sides of a onversation. This technique can be applied to case studies and problem solving as well.

109. **Teacher and Student** – Individually brainstorm the main points of the last homework, hen assign roles of teacher and student to pairs. The teacher’s job is to sketch the main oints, while the student’s job is to cross off points on his list as they are mentioned, but ome up with 2-3 ones missed by the teacher.

110. **Peer Review Writing Task** – To assist students with a writing assignments, encourage hem to exchange drafts with a partner. The partner reads the essay and writes a threeparagraph response: the first paragraph outlines the strengths of the essay, the second aragraph discusses the essay’s problems, and the third paragraph is a description of hat the partner would focus on in revision, if it were her essay.

111. **Invented Dialogues** – Students weave together real quotes from primary sources, or nvent ones to fit the speaker and context.

112. **My Christmas Gift** – Students mentally select one of their recent gifts as related to or mblematic of a concept given in class, and must tell their partners how this gift relates to he concept. The one with a closer connection wins.

113. **Psychoanalysis** – Students get into pairs and interview one another about a recent earning unit. The focus, however, is upon analysis of the material rather than rote emorization. Sample Interview Questions: Can you describe to me the topic that you ould like to analyze today? What were your attitudes/beliefs before this topic? How did our attitudes/beliefs change after learning about this topic? How will/have your ctions/decisions altered based on your learning of this topic? How have your erceptions of others/events changed?

114. **Get One, Give One** – Students fold a piece of paper in half and write “Give One” on one ide and “Get One” on the other side. On the “Give One” side, as them to write four nsights from today’s material. Have them stand up and find a partner. Each student hares one idea from their “Give One” side of the paper and writes down one idea on the Get One” side of the paper. Find a new partner until your “Get One” side of paper is full f new ideas! tudent Action: Groups

115. **Jigsaw (Group Experts)** – Give each group a different topic. Re-mix groups with one lanted “expert” on each topic, who now has to teach his new group. Also useful to have hem teach each other sections of the syllabus on the first day.

116. **Single Jigsaw** – Divide the class in two. After speed sharing or similar activity, each erson finds a partner from the other group to do a lengthy debrief.

117. **Carousel Brainstorming** – Everyone in the group writes out a problem statement, hen passes the paper to the student on the left. This student records one possible answer r idea. At the signal, all papers shift to the left again, until the entire circle has seen each aper and they return to their original owners.

118. **World Café** – Small groups tackle the same driving question; plenary debrief, then veryone except table hosts find a new table (new groups) for a second discussion uestion. The host leads discussions and draws ideas between rounds, taking notes for ticky wall posters.

119. **Mystery Numbers** – Every student in the group gets a unique number (such as 1-5), ut the teacher doesn’t announce until AFTER the discussion period which person  (number) is going to report back to the larger class. This will convince everyone to articipate fully.

120. **Assembling Strips** – Give each group an envelope with cut-out strips that assemble into  timeline, a plan of action, etc. Option: include "too many" so groups have to be selective.

121. **Empty Table** – Hand each group a blank table with headers in place for rows and olumns, but interior cells are blank until the group fills them in (example: column eaders could be different authors such as Shakespeare, Goethe, etc, and row headers ould be genres such as poems, novels, essays, etc)

122. **Group Symbols** – Ask students in groups to come up with a summary (or thesis tatement) of the reading on a scrap of paper, then add a handwritten symbol or stick igure drawing to identify the scrap. Pass to the right, pausing at each group, until veryone has seen everything. Using the symbols as identification, each group decide hich two statements are the best, and record the votes on the board.

123. **With a Creative Twist** – When assigning group presentations of different topics, each roup also gets a 'twist' at random (such as must deliver some lines as limericks, must resent part as karaoke song, etc)

124. **Gap Exercise** – Students freewrite for five minutes on "what is" versus "what should be" or some other gap in your field) then debrief in threes. When it's a student's turn, she irst summarizes her freewrite and then is silent and listens as the other two ask uestions only (give no advice, do not swap stories), then work around the group every ouple of minutes.

125. **Brain Drain** – Divide students into groups of 5 or 6. Hand out an empty grid of six rows nd three columns to every student. Provide a prompt or task at the top to brainstorm. ach person brainstorms possible answers in row one. After three minutes, rotate papers lockwise and work on row 2 (but do not repeat any answers from row 1). Continue until heet is filled in, then debrief to find the best answers.

126. **Interactive Lit Review** – Give a different snippet of reading to each group in the room nd a specific task (such as “map ideas onto this larger set of principles you see on the creen”); capture bullets onto the board, then follow with a Gallery Walk to lead to more ebrief.

127. **Balloon Pop** – Give each group an inflated balloon with the task/problem trapped nside on a piece of paper. At the signal, all groups pop their balloons. Injects fun, noise, nd energy to a group assignment.

128. **Things You Know** – Give an envelope to every student. Inside are cut-up strips of aper with the topics/principles they should know about already. They divide into two iles: things they know well, and things they need help with. Then they debrief with earby students on things any of them need help with.

129. **Board Rotation** – Assign groups of students to each of the boards you have set up in he room (four or more works best), and assign one topic/question per board. After each roup writes an answer, they rotate to the next board and write their answer below the irst, and so on around the room. Variations: pass around flipchart paper with the same ask, or use the idea of “table topics” where the topic stays at one table while students otate. Consider using Google Docs for common note-taking at each table.

130. **Make it a Story** – Encourage students to submit their group projects as a comic or story reated online (bubblr, StripCreator, StoryJumper, or Storify)

131. **Creating Categories** – In groups, students freewrite a position statement about your opic. Then they sort quotes/claims on strips of paper that you handed out, by creating ategories as they go. Finally, they add their position statements on (or between) ategories. The exercise should point out "families" of assumptions about a topic.

132. **Pass the Problem** – Divide students into groups. Give the first group a case or a roblem and ask them to identify (and write down) the first step in solving the problem r analyzing the case (3 minutes). Pass the problem on to the next group and have them dentify the next step. Continue until all groups have contributed.

133. **Pick the Winner** – Divide the class into groups and have all groups work on the same roblem and record an answer/strategy on paper. Then, ask groups to switch with a earby group, and evaluate their answer. After a few minutes, allow each set of groups to  merge and ask them to select the better answer from the two choices, which will be resented to the class as a whole.

134. **Layered Cake Discussion** – Every table/group works on the same task for a few inutes, then there’s a plenary debrief for the whole class, and finally repeat with a new opic to be discussed in the groups.

135. **Claymation Videos** – Instead of a written paper or essay, the deliverable of a group roject can be a video uploaded to YouTube created by the group using modeling clay and  stop-motion video app on their smartphones.

136. **Student Learning Communities** – Like faculty learning communities, these ommunities of practice are meant to invest the participants with ownership and a focus n sharing and joint discovery. Can be structured or unstructured.

137. **Lecture Reaction** – Divide the class into four groups after a lecture: questioners (must sk two questions related to the material), example givers (provide applications), ivergent thinkers (must disagree with some points of the lecture), and agreers (explain hich points they agreed with or found helpful). After discussion, brief the whole class.

138. **Movie Application** – In groups, students discuss examples of movies that made use of  concept or event discussed in class, trying to identify at least one way the movie-makers ot it right, and one way they got it wrong.

139. **Student Pictures** – Ask students to bring their own pictures from home to illustrate a pecific concept to their working groups.

140. **Definitions and Applications** – In groups, students provide definitions, associations, nd applications of concepts discussed in lecture.

141. **TV Commercial** – In groups, students create a 30-second TV commercial for the ubject currently being discussed in class. Variation: ask them to act out their ommercials.

142. **Blender** – Students silently write a definition or brainstorm an idea for several minutes n paper. Then they form into groups, and two of them read their ideas and integrate lements from each. A third student reads his, and again integration occurs with the revious two, until finally everyone in the group has been integrated (or has attempted ntegration).

143. **Human Tableau or Class Modeling** – Groups create living scenes (also of inanimate bjects) which relate to the classroom concepts or discussions.

144. **Build From Restricted Components** – Provide limited resources (or a discrete list of deas that must be used) and either literally or figuratively dump them on the table, sking students in groups to construct a solution using only these things (note: may be amiliar from the Apollo 13 movie). If possible, provide red herrings, and ask students to onstruct a solution using the minimum amount of items possible.

145. **Ranking Alternatives** – Teacher gives a situation, everyone thinks up as many lternative courses of action (or explanations of the situation) as possible. Compile list. In roups, now rank them by preference.

146. **Simulation** – Place the class into a long-term simulation (like as a business) to enable roblem-Based Learning (PBL).

147. **Group Instructional Feedback Technique** – Someone other than the teacher polls roups on what works, what doesn’t, and how to fix it, then reports them to the teacher.

148. **Classroom Assessment Quality Circles** – A small group of students forms a committee” on the quality of teaching and learning, which meets regularly and includes he instructor.

149. **Audio and Videotaped Protocols** – Taping students while they are solving problems ssesses the learner’s awareness of his own thinking.

150. **Imaginary Show and Tell** – Students pretend they have brought an object relevant to urrent discussion, and “display” it to the class while talking about its properties.

151. **Six Degrees of “RNA Transcription Errors”** – Like the parlor game “Six Degrees of evin Bacon” (in which actors are linked by joint projects), you provide groups with a onceptual start point and challenge them to leap to a given concept in six moves or ewer. One student judge in each group determines if each leap is fair and records the ature of the leaps for reporting back to the class.  152. **Sticky Note Discussions** – Divide students into cooperative groups and have them ead individually. Ask them to use sticky notes to mark places that they want to talk about n the text. Then direct them to reread as a group and discuss the parts they have marked.

153. **Pinwheel Discussions** – Students are divided into groups. All but one of the groups re assigned to specific topics or positions, while the fourth group is designated as the provocateur” group. Each group chooses a speaker, and speakers sit facing each other ith their other group members seated fanned out behind them (the overhead view of his configuration looks like a pinwheel). The speakers discuss their assigned positions or provoke further discussion, if in the “provocateur” group), and every few minutes, ew speakers rotate in and continue the discussion.

154. **Snowball Discussions** – Students form pairs and respond to a discussion question osed by the instructor. After a few moments, pairs join together to form groups of 4 and hare their ideas. Groups of 4 then join to create groups of 8, and so forth until the entire lass is engaged in discussion. econd Chance Testing (Note: term grading schemes should be adjusted to avoid undue grade inflation)

155. **Déjà vu** – Let students know the next class period they will be given the IDENTICAL test hey just took, and create time for them to discuss in groups what they answered and why. he second test will also be taken by individuals.

160. **Group Second-Test** – Students take the test individually at first. Then, they take the ame test a second time, this time in a group, defending their answers. The individual esults should count for more points than the group effort.

161. **Draw Your Partner** – All students draw a number, then find a partner with the same umber, and pair up to exchange information in the final few minutes of a test. uthorized “Cheating” on In-Class Quizzes (Note: this stresses practice over summative assessment; term rading schemes should be adjusted to avoid undue grade inflation)

162. **Free Time with Notes** – Near the end of the quizzing period, give the students a pecific time frame (e.g., 30 seconds) to glance silently at their own notes—this ncourages effective note-taking for the future.

163. **Thy Neighbor’s Notes** – Students silently trade notes with a partner and can only use HOSE notes to cheat from (in the final seconds of allowable time).

164. **Thy Neighbor’s Brain** – Students are given some precious seconds to talk to each ther, usually done WITHOUT allowing them to access notes. Variation: force the onversations to be in whispers only.

165. **No Talking!** – Students are given a specific time frame to literally compare answers with eighbors. The catch is, the entire experience must be 100% silent—no talking or noises. estures and light touching to gain attention are allowed. esting Strategies  166. **Redacted Test** – A few days before the chapter test, deliver to students the ACTUAL test uestions to be used, only with key information blacked out (example: “The BLANK law f thermodynamics states that BLANK”). Do not include the multiple choice answers at his stage, which forces students to generate their own effectively tuned study guides.

167. **Test Variants** – Testing in large lecture classes with cramped seating can lead to heating. Creating two versions of the test, and forcing students to alternate while seated n the row, can reduce cheating. Rather than completely different questions, it may be ore fair simply to scramble the order in which the (same) questions are delivered across ariants.

168. **Bluffed Test Variants** – Simply handing out the paper test photocopied onto two ifferent colors, even if using the same questions and the same order, can reduce student heating. ouTube

172. **Interactive Video Quizzes** – Using annotations (text boxes) and making them yperlinks to other uploaded videos, instructors can construct an on-screen “multiple hoice” test leading to differentiated video reactions, depending on how the student nswers. Requires filming multiple videos and some editing work.

173. **Movie Clips** – Show brief segments of popular movies to illustrate a point, start a onversation, have students hunt for what the movie gets wrong, etc.

200. **Question and Answer Cards** – Make index cards for every student in the class; half ith questions about class content; half with the right answers. Shuffle the cards and have tudents find their appropriate partner by comparing questions and answers on their own ards.

201. **Telescoping Images** – When you need the class to form new groups, craft sets of index ards that will be grouped together by theme, and randomly pass them out for students to eek the other members of their new groups. Example: one set of four index cards has ictures of Europe on a map, then France, then the Eiffel Tower, then a person wearing a eret (thematically, the images “telescope” from far away to close up, and the students ust find others in their particular set of telescoping images).

202. **Speed Sharing** – Students write definitions, concepts, quiz questions, etc. on index ards and form two concentric circles, facing each other. For thirty seconds (or 60), they hare their knowledge with the person opposite them. Then, the outer circle “rotates” so hat everyone has a new partner, and the sharing is repeated. This can be done until each tudent has completed the circuit.

203. **Trio Rotation** – Group students into threes, and arrange the groups into a large circle. ach team of three works on a problem. Then, each team assigns a 1, 2, and 3 number to ach person.

224. **Wheel in a Wheel** – Ask half of the class form a circle facing outward. Then have the ther half of the class form a circle around those students, facing inward, so that they are acing one of the students in the inner circle. The inner circle remains seated throughout he exercise, while the outer circle rotates to the right, one person at a time. With each ew pairing you provide a discussion topic/question that will help the students get to now one another. Make sure both partners have time to share.

Multiple variations are possible in “forcing” articular types of comments (i.e., require two compliments and two instances of onstructive feedback). Then, ask students to create a pile of comments for Student X, nother pile for Student Y, and so on.  260. **PowerPoint Presentations** – For those teaching in computer-mediated environments, ut students into groups of three or four students. Students focus their attention on a hapter or article and present this material to the class using PowerPoint. Have groups onference with you beforehand to outline their presentation strategy and ensure overage of the material.

261. **Shower Boards** – Purchase a slab of shower board from a home improvement store for nder $20 and have them cut it into four parts. Use these four boards as whiteboards in tudent groups; they bring the boards to the front to offer their presentations. rainstorming

267. **Brainstorming in a Circle** – Group students to discuss an issue together, and then pend a few minutes jotting down individual notes. One person starts a brainstorming list nd passes it to the student to the right, who then adds to the list and passes it along gain.

268. **Chalk Talk** – Ask students to go to multiple boards around the room to brainstorm nswers to a prompt/assignment, but disallow all talking. Can also be done in groups. nline Interaction

269. **Online Chat (All-Day)** – For classes meeting at least partially in an online nvironment, instructors can simulate the benefits gained by a chat-room discussion more participation from reserved instructors) without requiring everyone to meet in a hat room for a specific length of time. The day begins with a post from the instructor in a iscussion board forum. Students respond to the prompt, and continue to check back all ay, reading their peers’ posts and responding multiple times throughout the day to xtend discussion.

270. **Online Chat (Quick)** – To gauge a quick response to a topic or reading assignment, ost a question, and then allow students to chat in a synchronous environment for the ext 10 minutes on the topic. A quick examination of the chat transcript will reveal a ultitude of opinions and directions for further discussion. In online environments, any students can “talk” at once, with less chaotic and more productive results than in a ace-to-face environment.

271. **Online Evaluation** – For those teaching in online environments, schedule a time which tudents can log on anonymously and provide feedback about the course and your eaching. Understand, however, that anonymity online sometimes breeds a more ggressive response than anonymity in print.  272. **Pre-Class Writing** – A few days before your computer-mediated class begins, have tudents respond in an asynchronous environment to a prompt about this week’s topic. ach student should post their response and at least one question for further discussion. uring the face-to-face meeting, the instructor can address some of these questions or reas not addressed in the asynchronous forum.

273. **E-Mail Feedback** – Instructor poses questions about his teaching via e-mail; students reply anonymously.
